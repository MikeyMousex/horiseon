# Horiseon
My first assignment for the University of MN Coding Bootcamp - updating a website for SEO company Horiseon in order to meet accessibility standards.   
   
What you will find:   
index.html with improved accessibility features, cleaner code, and comments providing insight on the exact changes I made.   
style.css with compiled formatting, cleaner code, and comments in the code to show the updates I made.
